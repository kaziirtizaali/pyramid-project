# Pyramids Of Giza

In this project I've constructed a 3D-structure of the Pyramids Of Giza. Here I've used the OpenGL(Open Graphics Library) in C++. Mainly I've drawn the Pyramids of Giza including it's surrounding. The three pyramids are the main attraction here. The OpenGL built in functions are used to draw different shapes and coordinates. Lighting, Textures have also been focused here. There are also day view, night view, zoom in/out etc features which makes the whole environment appealing to the viewer.

## Development and Resources

The following technologies has been used here:
 
#### Tools / Framework:
* Programming Language: C++
* OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)

## Features

* Good representation of the three pyramids of Giza.
* Textures on the pyramids and the overall environment.
* Day-Night effect has been shown.
* Zoom in, zoom out features on the overall structures.
* Applying lighting effect on the structure.


## Special Effects

* Lighting effect on the whole scene.
* Day-Night effect ambient light and directional light.
* Applying textures on the pyramids and the sand.
